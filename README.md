# Vape v4.06
Dumped Vape JAR, DLL & Assets.

Notes:
- If you want to retrieve the names of the asset files, you'll need to <s>write a custom JVMTI agent to hook the "gt" method found in a/a.
(The XOR key for the names can be retrieved from calling / hooking "gk" from a/a).</s> compile & use use the supplied JVMTI [Agent](Agent/dllmain.cpp).

- If you would like to know what any of the native methods do, please feel free to contact me on my Discord, Decencies#4550.
